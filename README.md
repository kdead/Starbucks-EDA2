    <h1><b>ðŸ“– Mini-Project - Streamlit App for EDA with Starbucks Data</b></h1>
  </div>
</div>

## Introduction
Welcome to this hands-on mini-project where you'll be creating a Streamlit web application to showcase EDA using Starbucks data! In this mini-project, we'll focus on preparing the data for analysis, an essential step in any data project. Mimicking real-life scenarios, you'll encounter some common data cleaning tasks that will enhance your skills. You can find a link to the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/henryshan/starbucks/data). **UPDATE:** To focus on practicing with Streamlit, a clean version of this dataset has been added in the `data` folder. **You won't need to execute the cleaning steps outlined below**, but it's essential to acknowledge that often, data cleaning is a prerequisite for effective EDA. 


## [ALREADY COMPLETED FOR YOU âœ…] Data Cleaning
Your primary objective is to create a Streamlit app that visualizes insights from Starbucks data. However, before you can effectively analyze the data, you need to perform some data cleaning. You should do this in a Jupyter Notebook that you create. Here are the key tasks:

1. **Examine and Rename Columns:**
   - Carefully inspect the column names in the Starbucks dataset. You may notice some unusual spaces. Rename the columns to ensure consistency and clarity. Work together on this!

2. **Remove Percentage Signs:**
   - Some columns may contain values with percentage signs (%). These need to be removed to convert the columns to float types, enabling more accurate analysis.

3. **Convert to Number Types:**
   - Identify columns that should be represented as numerical types and ensure they are converted accordingly. This step is crucial for accurate statistical analysis and visualization.

## Streamlit App Development

### App Structure
Your Streamlit app should have a clear and organized structure to effectively communicate your Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) insights. Follow these guidelines:

#### 1. **Home Page:**
   - Welcome users to your app with a greeting or introduction.
   - Enhance the visual appeal by incorporating pictures, emojis, or other engaging elements.
   - Create an inviting atmosphere to encourage users to explore and navigate through your application.

#### 2. **Overview of the Data:**
   - Include a section that provides a brief overview of the Starbucks dataset. Describe the key features, data types, and any notable aspects that users should be aware of.

#### 3. **EDA Page:**
   - Dedicate a separate page or section of your app to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). This is where you'll showcase visualizations and insights derived from the cleaned dataset.

### Visualizations
Focus on creating visualizations that reveal distributions and relationships within the data. Consider using a variety of charts and plots, such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots. Additionally, feel free to explore any other aspects of the data that interest you and not explicitly covered in class!

#### Example Visualizations:
   - **Histograms:** Display the distribution of numerical features.
   - **Scatter Plots:** Explore relationships between two numerical variables.
   - **Box Plots:** Highlight the spread and central tendency of key features.
   - **Bar Charts:** Showcase categorical data and comparisons.


Feel free to make your app visually appealing by experimenting with Streamlit's customization options. Have fun exploring and visualizing the Starbucks data in your Streamlit app! 

### **Submission Guidelines**

In addition to pushing your work to GitHub, please also record a **2-5 minute video** demonstrating your Streamlit app. Walk through the key features, visualizations, and insights you've gained from the Starbucks data. This is a great opportunity to explain your thought process and showcase your hard work!

When you're finished, submit both your GitHub repository link and your demonstration video.
